# Implementation of a Vanilla Javascript Frontend Router

See live preview on:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://efarioli.github.io/vanillajs-spa-app-withrouter/index.html

## Features:

- The web-app uses hash-based URLs, for example, #home, #posts, etc
- The web-app manager the browser history, you can back to a webpage, and forward as well.
- The router in the web application is not dependent on a server-side component.
- The different URL between the URL are direct shareable by copy and paste.
- If user access to index.html, the router redirects to #home, without adding the index.html to browser history.
- The router keeps track of what route is active, so by creating css class we can differentiate that.
